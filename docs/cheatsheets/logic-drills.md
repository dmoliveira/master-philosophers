# Logic Drills (10-20 Minutes) 🧠

Use these drills to sharpen reasoning speed and clarity.

## Drill 1: Argument Skeleton

Take any paragraph and rewrite it as:

```text
P1:
P2:
C:
```

Goal: separate conclusion from supporting reasons.

## Drill 2: Hidden Assumption Hunt

For one argument, write:

```text
If this argument is true, it must assume that...
```

Then test whether that assumption is plausible.

## Drill 3: Counterexample Sprint

Write one realistic case where the argument fails.

Goal: test scope, not just disagreement.

## Drill 4: Objection-Reply Pair

Write one objection and one possible reply in 4-6 lines each.

Goal: practice fair reconstruction before criticism.

## Drill 5: Validity Check

Ask two yes/no questions:

- If premises are true, must the conclusion be true?
- If not, what extra premise is missing?
