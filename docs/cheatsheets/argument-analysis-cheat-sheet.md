# Argument Analysis Cheat Sheet 🧩

Use this quick sheet while reading any philosopher.

## The 6-Step Reading Pass

1. **Claim**: What is the main thesis?
2. **Reason**: Why does the author think it is true?
3. **Assumption**: What is taken for granted?
4. **Counterexample**: Where could this fail?
5. **Reply**: How might the author answer that objection?
6. **Application**: Where does this matter today?

## Common Logical Checks

- Is the argument valid or only persuasive?
- Are key terms clearly defined?
- Is there a false dilemma?
- Is a historical claim being treated as a logical proof?
- Is correlation being confused with causation?

## Typical Fallacies to Watch

- Strawman
- Ad hominem
- Appeal to authority (without scope)
- Slippery slope (without mechanism)
- Circular reasoning
