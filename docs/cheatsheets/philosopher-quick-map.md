# Philosopher Quick Map 🗺️

This is a one-glance map of major thinkers, their lane, and why they matter.

## Fast Progression Paths

- Foundations first: Plato -> Aristotle -> Confucius
- Ethics and self-mastery: Epicurus -> Epictetus -> Marcus Aurelius
- Faith and reason bridge: Augustine -> Avicenna -> Maimonides -> Aquinas
- State and legitimacy: Hobbes -> Locke -> Rousseau -> Mill
- Critique path: Hume -> Marx -> Nietzsche
- Logic and language path: Aristotle -> Frege -> Russell -> Wittgenstein

## Classical and Early Foundations

- Plato -> justice, forms, education, political order
- Aristotle -> logic, virtue, causation, practical reason
- Confucius -> role ethics, social harmony, self-cultivation
- Epicurus -> tranquility, desire discipline, fear reduction
- Epictetus / Marcus Aurelius -> Stoic agency and resilience

## Faith and Scholastic Synthesis

- Augustine -> interiority, time, will, theology and self
- Avicenna -> essence/existence, metaphysical necessity
- Maimonides -> reason + scripture reconciliation
- Aquinas -> natural law, faith and reason architecture

## Modern State and Knowledge Debates

- Descartes -> certainty, method, mind-body dualism
- Hobbes -> social contract, security-first sovereignty

## Ideology, Social Order, and Critique

- Kant -> autonomy, duty, conditions of knowledge
- Hegel -> history, institutions, dialectical development
- Mill -> liberty, harm principle, civic pluralism
- Marx -> class conflict, capitalism critique, communism framework
- Nietzsche -> morality/religion critique, value revaluation

## Analytic and Language Turn

- Frege -> predicate logic and sense/reference
- Russell -> logical analysis method
- Wittgenstein -> language games, meaning as use

## 4-Lane Study Labeling
