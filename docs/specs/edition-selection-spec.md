# Edition Selection Spec 📖

Use these simple rules when you need to pick between editions.

## Priority Order 🎯

1. Translation quality and readability.
2. Notes, glossary, and editorial apparatus.
3. Total landed cost in AUD.
4. Physical durability (if long-term reference copy).

## Two-Copy Strategy (Recommended) 🧩

- Copy A (cheap): low-cost reading copy for heavy annotation.
- Copy B (reference): critical or annotated edition for long-term use.

## Trigger for Upgrading Edition ⬆️

Upgrade when one of these is true:

- You are writing essays and need citation-grade notes.
- You are rereading the same work for a second pass.
- The low-cost translation obscures key terms.

## Notes Format 🗒️

When adding a new book in `docs/books.md`, include:

- Edition name
- Seller link
- AUD price snapshot and date
- One-line reason this edition is recommended
