# Books (AU-First Pricing and Links)

Price goal: prioritize AU stores first, then imported options only when total converted cost is better.

## Buying Rules

- AU-first: QBD, Booktopia, Dymocks, local independent stores.
- Compare on total landed cost (book + shipping), not sticker price only.
- If imported option is cheaper after FX conversion, mark as priority fallback.

## Price Snapshot

- Captured: 2026-02-28
- Currency baseline: AUD
- USD conversion used for quick compare: 1 USD ~= 1.58 AUD
- Important: prices and stock move; re-check before purchase.
