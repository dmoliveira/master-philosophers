# Content Quality Audit (Current Snapshot)

This quick audit highlights practical gaps that reduce site usefulness and what
to improve next.

## Weak points found

- Contemporary coverage gap: core map ended near early analytic traditions,
  leaving late-20th and 21st-century debates underrepresented.
- Donation/support gap: no clear way for readers to fund maintenance or new
  content work.
- Pricing maintenance risk: AU price tables age quickly, which can reduce trust
  if values drift without regular refresh.
- Learning progression gap: beginners had strong classical routes but fewer
  clear modern pathways by topic (justice, identity, power, capability).

## Improvements landed in this pass

- Added contemporary philosopher profiles in `docs/authors.md`.
- Added modern/contemporary starter shelf and catalog entries in `docs/books.md`.
- Added review stubs for modern texts in `docs/reviews/core-book-reviews.md`.
- Added project funding page in `docs/support-the-project.md`.

## Suggested next improvements

- Add one themed path per month (for example: justice, gender, postcolonial,
  technology ethics).
- Add a lightweight monthly pricing refresh log entry with date and source.
- Add a "new this month" box on `docs/index.md` to surface fresh additions.
