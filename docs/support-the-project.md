# Support the Project

If this study hub saves you time or helps your learning routine, you can support
ongoing updates and maintenance.

## Fastest setup with Stripe

1. Create a payment link in Stripe Dashboard.
2. Choose one-time support amount (for example: 5, 15, 30 AUD).
3. Copy the hosted payment URL.
4. Replace the placeholder link below with your real URL.

Support link placeholder:

- `https://buy.stripe.com/your-live-link`

Once your link is live, readers can contribute without account creation.

## Suggested support tiers

- 5 AUD: keeps links, references, and typo fixes moving.
- 15 AUD: helps fund monthly source refresh and edition checks.
- 30 AUD: helps fund new study templates and modern thinker expansions.

## Trust and transparency notes

- Keep support optional; all core learning content remains free.
- Add a short monthly changelog note describing what support funded.
- Avoid promising private coaching unless you explicitly offer it.

## Alternative funding ideas

- Add a GitHub Sponsors profile for recurring support.
- Offer a paid printable bundle (worksheets + reading trackers).
- Offer a community workshop recording pack with discussion prompts.
