# Regional and Language Access Alternatives 🌐

Use this guide when a resource is blocked, expensive, language-limited, or too bandwidth-heavy.

## Access Strategy

1. Prefer free text-first sources when video is unavailable.
2. Use public-domain sources when paid editions are inaccessible.
3. Keep one global source plus one local-language source when possible.
4. Save offline notes so learning is not platform-dependent.

## Low-Bandwidth and Offline First

- Prefer transcript/article versions before long video.
- Use EPUB/PDF public-domain texts from Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, or Wikisource.
- Download one weekly source locally for offline reading.

## Language-Aware Alternatives

- SEP/IEP for English reference accuracy.
- Wikipedia language editions for orientation in native language.
- Wikisource language portals for public-domain translations.
- Local university lecture notes (search by country + "philosophy syllabus pdf").

## Regional Content Paths

- Global baseline: SEP + IEP + Open Yale.
- Europe: Europeana + national library digitized collections.
- Latin America: prioritize university open-course PDFs and public-library scans.
- South Asia: combine internet archives with local-language commentary resources.
- East Asia: pair Confucian/classical resources with local-language lecture explainers.

## If a Link Fails

- Step 1: search the same title in `archive.org`.
- Step 2: search a SEP/IEP entry for alternate citations.
- Step 3: note the replacement in your weekly log.

## Accessibility Notes

- Prefer resources with transcript/subtitles.
- Keep alt text when adding images to docs.
- Use short sections and clear headings for scan-friendly reading.
