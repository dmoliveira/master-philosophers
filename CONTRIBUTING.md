# Contributing 🤝

Thanks for helping improve this philosophy learning repo.

## Scope 🎯

- Keep content practical for study execution.
- Prefer concise, structured markdown over long prose blocks.
- Keep AU-first buying and pricing references current when possible.

## File Structure Rules 🗂️

- Author facts and intellectual shifts: `docs/authors.md`
- Book links and price snapshots: `docs/books.md`
- Reading notes/reviews: `docs/reviews/`
- Study schedules and pacing: `docs/plan/`
- Reusable checklists/templates: `docs/templates/`

## Writing Style ✍️

- Use plain, friendly English and short bullets.
- Add dates for any price snapshot.
- Mark uncertain values explicitly as estimates.
- If a section gets too large, split into a new markdown file and link it.

## Pricing Update Rules 💸

- Prefer AU sellers first.
- When adding imported options, include total landed estimate.
- Use explicit conversion assumptions (for example: `1 USD ~= 1.58 AUD`).

## Pull Request Checklist ✅

- [ ] Added or updated links without breaking existing references.
- [ ] Updated any affected index links in `README.md`.
- [ ] Kept sections small enough to scan quickly.
- [ ] Included date/source notes for pricing changes.

## Support and Sustainability

- Reader support link (Stripe): [Support via Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/8x200i8bSgVe3Vl3g8bfO00)
- Keep support messaging honest: content stays free, support funds maintenance and growth.
- If you update support messaging, also update `docs/support-the-project.md` and `docs/wiki-support-snippet.md`.
