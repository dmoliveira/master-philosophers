# Influential Philosophers Reading Plan

This file is now a lightweight index to avoid duplication drift.
Use the linked docs below as the single source of truth.

## Start Here

1. Read `docs/authors.md` for thinker overviews and intellectual shifts.
2. Pick editions and buying paths in `docs/books.md`.
3. Follow `docs/plan/study-plans.md` for 6-month or 12-month pacing.
4. Use `docs/templates/weekly-study-checklist.md` to execute each week.
5. Capture reflections in `docs/reviews/core-book-reviews.md`.

## Recommended Reading Flow

1. Plato -> Aristotle
2. Confucius (parallel classical stream)
3. Epicurus -> Epictetus -> Marcus Aurelius
4. Plotinus -> Augustine -> Avicenna -> Maimonides -> Aquinas
5. Descartes -> Hobbes -> Locke -> Hume -> Spinoza
6. Rousseau -> Kant -> Hegel
7. Kierkegaard -> Mill -> Marx -> Nietzsche
8. Frege -> Russell -> Wittgenstein

## Notes

- Keep additions and updates in the modular docs under `docs/`.
- If this flow changes, update `docs/plan/study-plans.md` first, then mirror the order here.
